Project HackING is a machine learning project with its goal to create an Artificial Intelligence model capable of
recognizing documents. Two techniques will be used - Image Recognition and Text Recognition. Final model will combine
the results from both techniques and assert the result based on those predictions.
The project uses a custom dataset that was used at a hackathon HackING in May 2023.

The project has the following structure:
    - Datasets: directory where all used datasets are
    - ImageRecognition: directory where module responsible for recognizing images is stored (including its models)
    - TextRecognition: directory where module responsible for recognizing text is stored (including its models)
    - Models: directory where all final models are stored (those combining both image and text recognition)
